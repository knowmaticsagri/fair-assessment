                            Welcome to SATIFYD: the DANS Self-Assessment Tool to Improve the FAIRness of Your Dataset.
                            This tool will show you how FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) your
                            dataset is and will provide you with tips to score (even) higher on FAIRness.
                            Ideally, you use this tool prior to the deposit in EASY.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 12 questions touch upon the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/"
                                target="_blank">FAIR data principles<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> but do not
                            strictly follow them. While answering the questions, the score per letter will be displayed
                            underneath each letter.
                            The more ‘blue’ the letters get, the more FAIR your dataset is. An overall score is provided
                            at the end of the page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some questions are posed more than once (e.g. on metadata and data standards or usage
                            licences), because the topics are relevant in more than one letter.
                        </p>

            SATIFYD stands for: Self-Assessment Tool to Improve the FAIRness of Your Dataset. It is designed for manual
            assessment by the user, prior to the deposit of a dataset.
            <br><br>
            <b>12 questions</b>
            <br><br>
            The 12 questions of the tool are divided into three questions per letter, are based on the <a
                href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR data principles<i
                    class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
            Those aspects of the FAIR principles which are already covered by EASY (e.g. whether or not the dataset will
            have a Persistent Identifier assigned), are left out this tool.
            Questions which typically concern machine readability are those about (meta)data standards such as
            controlled vocabularies, ontologies and taxonomies.
            Some questions are posed more than once (e.g. on metadata and data standards or usage licences), because the
            topics are relevant in more than one letter.
            Explanatory texts can be found with each question, by clicking on the “i” symbol.
            <br><br>
            <b>Scores</b>
            <br><br>
            After answering the questions, the letters are filled with blue color according to the percentage. An
            overall score is provided at the end of the page.
            The degree to which a dataset can be made FAIR is different for each discipline. Some have more standards
            available than others. In order to do justice to this difference,
            options to indicate that standards are not available have been added to the tool. Tips to improve the
            FAIRness of the dataset can be found at each letter, by clicking on ‘Want to improve?’.
            <br><br>
            <b>Background</b>
            <br><br>
            A prototype of a FAIR data assessment tool was established and first published in the summer of 2017 (see <a
                href="http://blog.ukdataservice.ac.uk/fair-data-assessment-tool/" target="_blank">blog<i
                    class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> by Emily Thomas).
            The tool gives a 5-star rating for the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability of a
            dataset as well as a score of its overall FAIRness.
            After having received feedback from a broad range of users, it became clear that a step towards a full
            version of the FAIRdat tool meant to reformulate questions,
            provide more overview and reconsider the level of FAIR assessment (repository, dataset, files).
            <br><br>
            In 2018, a simple checklist to ‘roughly’ evaluate the FAIRness of datasets was created to give researchers
            with little experience in sharing their research resources an idea of what
            FAIR data sharing means. The questions are kept simple, the corresponding paragraphs containing explanations
            of terms and concepts short and concise. The checklist titled “FAIR enough?
            Checklist to evaluate FAIRness of data(sets)” which was first presented during the EOSC Stakeholder Forum in
            Vienna in November 2018, is accessible <a

            SATIFYD was established by DANS: Eliane Fankhauser, Jerry de Vries, Nina Westzaan, Vesa Åkerman in 2019. Its
            layout is based on and inspired by the
            <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/resources/working-with-data/fair-data/fair-self-assessment-tool"
                target="_blank">ARDC FAIR self assessment tool<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
            The initial idea and a first prototype were established by Peter Doorn, Eleftheria Tsoupra and Emily Thomas
            at DANS in 2017-2018.

            Now that you have finished your research project, you are on the brink of depositing your research data in a
            trustworthy long-term repository.
            Findability is one of the four pillars of the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/"
                target="_blank">FAIR Guiding Principles <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
            If you take care of the findability of your data, you will enable search engines to find it and possibly
            also link it to related sources on the web.
            Moreover, you will improve the exposure of your research and help researchers to find and potentially reuse
            your data.
            <br><br>
            Findability generally comes down to giving a proper description of your dataset.
            This description can be divided into three elements:
            <ul>
                <li>Rich and detailed metadata and additional information</li>
                <li>Persistent links / Persistent Identifiers (provided by EASY after the deposit of the dataset)</li>
                <li>Standards: the more standardized terms you use, the more findable your data are. Some domains have
                    specific standards,
                    for other domains there are more generic standards like the Getty Thesaurus of Geographical Names or
                    the .
                    Using standards will enable peers to find your data through (domain-specific) search engines.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="F-i-1-contents">
            Metadata is information that describes an object such as a dataset. It gives context to the research data,
            providing information about the URL where the dataset is stored,
            creator, provenance, purpose, time, geographic locations, access conditions, and terms of use of a data
            collection. The extent to which metadata is provided for a dataset
            can vary greatly and has an effect on how findable a dataset is. In EASY a minimum number of metadata fields
            are required in order to successfully deposit a dataset.
            The minimum metadata, however, is not comprehensive enough to fulfil the requirements of FAIR. The following
            list provides a comprehensive list of items that should be covered
            when aiming for sufficient metadata:

            You can document your research on metadata level and on dataset level. In order to make your metadata
            interoperable and machine actionale, use standardised controlled vocabularies,
            thesauri, ontologies. On the dataset level you should provide a project description and a dataset
            description. For example, add a codebook to make your data understandable
            for other researchers, add provenance information and a data/workflow process description. If you want to
            get to know more about standards, see the second question under Findable.

            To make your (meta)data findable we encourage the use of controlled vocabularies, taxonomies and/or
            ontologies.
            <br><br>
            A <b>controlled vocabulary</b> is an organized and standardized list of terms and can be used to describe
            data. Controlled vocabularies are mostly discipline-specific and
            therefore very useful for describing your data. By using controlled vocabularies your metadata becomes much
            more understandable for machines and users and therefore they
            improve the findability of your data.
            <br><br>
            A <b>taxonomy</b> is a classification of entities in an ordered system. A taxonomy is mostly domain specific
            and is used to identify the content/data by adding terms from the
            taxonomy to the content/data description. Identifying content in a structured way gives search engines the
            opportunity to optimize their search functionality.
            In this way more relevant data can be found based on a single search query.
            Therefore adding taxonomy terms to your dataset description the findability of your dataset will improve.
            <br><br>
            An <b>ontology</b> is a formal description of knowledge. This knowledge is described as a set of concepts
            and relations between these concepts within a specific domain.
            Ontologies are created to organize information into data and knowledge. An ontology attempts to represent
            entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of
            categories.
            By applying existing ontologies to describe your data, your data becomes more understandable for machines
            and thus improves the findability of your data.
            <br><br>
            From ontologies it is a small step to <b>linked open data</b>. Making use of linked open data means that
            your data is interlinked with other data, that your data is openly accessible and that your data can be
            shared within the semantic web.
            In this way your data is published in a structured and understandable way. Linked (open) data is described
            as a set of triples; following the RDF data structure. triple is a basic set of a subject, a predicate and
            an object.
            For example, a subject is “grass”, its corresponding predicate “has color” and the object is “green”. By
            linking your data to other data, more knowledge and information and links to your data becomes available.
            This will help to increase the findability of your data.
            <br><br>
            It is true that standardized controlled vocabularies, taxonomies or ontologies are not equally developed in
            the disciplines. For some disciplines a broad range of standards are available whilst others have none yet.
            There are, however, general standards, such as the <a
                href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/" target="_blank">Getty Thesaurus <i
                    class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> for geographical names, which can be used across disciplines.
            <br><br>
            In EASY some metadata sections already offer (domain specific) controlled vocabularies. For instance, to
            describe the subject and the temporal coverage you can select term from the “Archeologisch Basis Register”
            (ABR) and the newer version ABRplus.
            These vocabularies are maintained by the Dutch “Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed”
            <br><br>
            For the ones among you who are interested in more technical background information: The EASY/DANS datavault
            offers standardised terms for creator and contributor, these are derived
            from <a href="http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.0/include/datacite-contributorType-v4.xsd"
                target="_blank">DataCite <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. To specify a Relation the standard

            For language the ISO 639 standard is used and for date fields the ISO 8601 standard is used.

            Additional information is information that helps users to assess the content and the relevance of the
            dataset they are viewing. The most important means to provide additional information is a so-called readme
            file in which topics like the structure of the dataset are addressed.
            Questions like how many files does the dataset contain and how are they related to each other? Which
            software has to be used to assess the data? How many versions of data are contained in the dataset? Help
            users to assess and contextualize the dataset.
            Other topics to address include but are by no means limited to methodologies used, a detailed summary of the
            project in which the data was collected, information about whether and how the data was cleaned, how many
            versions of the dataset were made etc.
            Information about the provenance and the versioning of your data, moreover, can be added in addition to the

        <!-- ======================================= Accessible  ======================================= -->

        <div id="A-i-contents">
            <p>
                The accessibility of a dataset and its corresponding metadata is essential for researchers to assess and
                potentially reuse a dataset.
                The questions that you will find under accessibility concern the accessibility of the metadata over
                time, meaning that the repository guarantees that the metadata will be available even if the data itself
                is no longer available, and the usage license chosen for the dataset.
                The latter determines to what extent or under which circumstances the dataset can be accessed. EASY has
                a number of usage licenses from which to choose, depending on the content of the data.
                In the FAIR Principles, the automated accessibility of metadata and data by machines is also covered
                under Accessibility.
                As EASY makes use of the <a href="https://dublincore.org/resources/metadata-basics/"
                    target="_blank">Dublin Core <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> metadata schema and provides a
                President Identifier (see Findability) for each dataset, the machine actionability of the metadata is
                covered.
                There is no question about this technical aspect in this part.

            Metadata as described in Question 1 is the description of your data. As such it is associated with your
            dataset. For the accessibility but also for the findability of your data it is essential that the metadata
            of the dataset remains accessible even if the data itself is not available anymore. It is the repository you
            deposit in, in our case EASY, which should ensure that this is the case.
            With this question we would like to encourage you to check whether the metadata in EASY is publicly

        <div id="A-i-2-contents">
            The extent to which you can make your dataset openly available depends on whether your dataset contains

            If you want other researchers to reuse your data, it is important that your data can be integrated in other
            data(sets).
            This process of exchanging information between different information systems such as applications, storage
            or workflows is called interoperability.
            The following actions will improve the interoperability of your data:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Use standardized controlled vocabularies, taxonomies and/or ontologies (see Question 2) both in

            Preferred formats not only give a higher certainty that your data can be read in the future, they will also
            help to increase the reusability and interoperability.
            Preferred formats are formats that are widely used and supported by the most commonly used software and
            tools. Using preferred formats enables data to be loaded directly
            into the software and tools used for data analysis. It makes it possible to easily integrate your data with
            other data using the same preferred format.
            The use of preferred formats will also help to transform the format to a newer one, in case a preferred

        <div id="R-i-contents">
            The ultimate goal in making data FAIR is to foster reusability. Whether or not datasets are reusable by
            other researchers is dependent on a number of aspects.
            One of the preconditions is that the dataset has a usage license which clarifies under which circumstances
            the data may be reused. Because of the importance of this aspect,
            the question about the licenses, which you already answered under Accessible, is repeated here. In order to
            gain insight into the process of data generation,
            it is important to describe the data and metadata as detailed as possible. Think of questions like Under
            which circumstances did I / we collect the data?
            Where does the data come from? Moreover, similar to aspects in Findable, Accessible and Interoperable, it is
            important that you meet the standards in your discipline when
            describing your data and metadata.
        </div>

        <div id="R-i-1-contents">
            To let other researchers make use of your dataset, it is essential to explain the origin of your data and
            what steps you have taken to produce the dataset.
            Therefore it is very important to provide provenance information with your dataset. This provenance
            information can consist of for instance the description of the
            origin of the data; How did you collect your data, did you reuse other data? In that case add the right
            citations to your dataset. Or did you create your own data?
            Describe the workflow for the data creation and describe the processing of the data. If you have used any
            versioning in your data, add this versioning information to your dataset.

            You have chosen the right license if your dataset cannot be accessed yet due to unpublished papers or an

            number of 24 month to have your dataset under embargo. Your dataset will score low under Accessabilty, as

            Not only has it become easier to find your data (see unddf 'F'), your metadata now also meets the
            requirements for proper and correct reuse. This is an important step for your data to become more FAIR.

            Your data meet domain standards to a certain extent. FAIR data should at least contain minimal information
            standards. Try to look for ways to improve. The more your data and metadata are organized in a standardized
            way, the better they are suited for re-use! Always try to keep in mind the user-perspective.

            Generic metadata standards are widely adopted. Domain standards, however, are much richer in vocabulary and
            structure and therefore will help researchers within your discipline to reuse your data. Check whether your
            domain has specific metadata standards.
